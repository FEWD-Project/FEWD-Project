		<p>WET is currently involved with this prestigious project of redeveloping Brisbane’s shipping wharfs into a modern, high class residential and commercial estate. The feature Riverside Parkland and entry streetscapes have been designed to conform with the highest standards of energy efficiency. A key component of the designed irrigation system is the ability to be operated manually from water trucks during establishment, then once the on-site water treatment plant is online, the irrigation can be switched over to fully automatic operation without any remedial works or disturbance to the site.</p><br>

		<p>On completion of the “Gardens By The Bay” project, it will be one of the largest irrigation systems in Southeast Asia.  Bold design concepts in landscape architecture and structural engineering will ensure this project will be a global focus for all landscape designers around the world for years to come. Amazing Supertrees stretching more than 30 stories high are constructed from steel skeletal frames with planting media covering to give the effect of a natural monster tree, to massive glass conservatories housing climate controlled environments for landscape from every region of the world. From major 3D pump station design, to open plan presentation turf zones with intricate botanical gardens, to micro sub-surface drip irrigation delivering precise quantities of nutrient enriched water for all plant species from around the world in on ground and vertical planted structures.</p><br>

		<article class="review three">
		<p>This project has been ongoing for the past 10 years, WET has been extensively involved with master planning and detail designing of the irrigation for the entire development. Currently they are involved with the concept development of alternative water supply to the entire estate. This involves water harvesting, bore supplies, and recycled water use. The current irrigation system is controlled by a sophisticated computer controlled central system which operates over 1000 valves in the field.</p><br>

		<p>WET designed and detailed the golf course irrigation layout for the XUAN THANH course in Vietnam. The level of detail required for the design was extremely involved as this allowed for suppliers here in Australia to perform a highly accurate materials costing and delivery schedule for the project in Vietnam without visiting the site. As a result they were able to deliver all required parts to the contractor on site with minimal parts variations to complete the irrigation works.</p><br>

		<p>WET carried out a Sustainable Water Management and Stormwater Harvesting report for the Brisbane City Council on the Botanical Gardens at Mt Coot-tha. The report identified the need to construct two dams that will hold a total capacity of 65mL. A pipeline and pumping system is required to transfer water between dams at a very high rate to enable the catchment and storage of the maximum stormwater available. As a result, the entire botanical gardens will be self-sustaining in its water supply and will rely on no other parties for its life blood. </p><br>

		<p>Inghams Chickens Pty Ltd are industry leaders when it comes to recycling water and waste from their chicken producing facilities. WET was approached to provide an energy efficient pump delivery and irrigation dispersal system to process the daily wastewater from the hatchery.</p><br>
